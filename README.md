This example demonstrates a subtle issue in Ruby when combining `method_missing` with direct access to instance variables. The `method_missing` method successfully intercepts calls to nonexistent methods, but attempting to access the instance variable `@value` directly (without a getter method) still results in a `NoMethodError`.  The solution involves creating a getter method to properly access the instance variable.
